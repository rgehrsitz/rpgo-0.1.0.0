Charts and visualizations in the HTML report now include:

1. **TSP Balance Over Time**: Line chart with realistic scale (.7M to M+)
2. **Net Income Comparison**: Line chart comparing both scenarios  
3. **Income Sources Over Time**: Stacked area charts for each scenario showing:
   - Salary (drops to 0 after retirement)
   - FERS Pension (starts after retirement)
   - TSP Withdrawal (increases over time)
   - Social Security (starts when claimed)

The charts now properly show the story of how income composition changes over the retirement timeline.
